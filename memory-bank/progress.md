# Progress — YNAB-lite PWA

**Last updated:** 2025-10-21

## Completed
- Project plan captured in `ynab-lite-pwa-plan.md` and mirrored across Memory Bank.

## In Progress
- Stage 0 (Environment Prep): awaiting Nuxt 3 project initialization, dependency installation, and baseline configuration.

## Next Up
1. Complete Stage 0 tasks and commit initial scaffold.
2. Proceed to Stage 1 (Data Layer) — implement Dexie schema and data access helpers.
3. Stage 2 (UI & Flows) — build dashboard, transaction form, filters, and navigation per plan once data layer is stable.

## Known Risks / Blockers
- Choice between strict TypeScript vs Zod-first validation needs confirmation before committing to one path.
- iOS PWA install and storage limits must be verified on-device once a build is available.
